Hi, I'm @JohnLeicht.
I'm 78yrs old and interested in building PWA's using Javascript.
I've created my environment: 
Windows 11, VSCode, GitHub Desktop, PWA template, repositories, clone and delete repositories.
I'm going to start building a desktop personal contacts app by bringing existing code into a repository.
